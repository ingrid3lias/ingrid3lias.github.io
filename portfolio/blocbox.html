			<h3>The Approach &amp; Process</h3>
		</header>
		<p>This project was presented to me as another iteration on the fundamental Dropbox model: sharing and saving information through a cloud-based web application. While the MVP Blocbox wanted to achieve is a well-known concept, they also wanted to include their own unique features at an extremely reasonable price point.</br></br>The goal was to present a product that could not only replace Dropbox as a means for sharing and collecting information, but could also work as a better version of a typical browser's book-marking tool.</br></br>User surveys were an integral part of the research for this product. I first wanted to find out what users thought of the competition, what they were actively using, and the problems that they found with what was already available in the marketplace. A very important feature in Blocbox is its cross-platform accessibility and ability to access your account from any device seamlessly. Researching the users, their habits, and coming up with appropriate user stories and personas was the main focus when deciding what features should be prominent and available upon launch.</p>

			<h3>Prototyping</h3>
		</header>
		<p>Prototyping played a large role in the development of this SAAS application. I wanted to check to see if users were understanding the flow of the site, and were finding their way around successfully and quickly. User Testing, InVision and Usability Hub, were implemented for Blocbox testing purposes before beginning the hi-fidelity mock-ups &amp; visual designs.</p>

			<h3>The Logo</h3>
		</header>
		<p>Deciding on an appropriate color palette and logo were the first steps in successfully branding this application. The web app's purpose is to collect and share saved images, links, and documents with friends and colleagues. Users could potentially subscribe to the service casually or with business-oriented intentions. Because of this dichotomy, I wanted to the brand to represent a serious product with a playful edge.</br></br>When brainstorming for Blocbox's logo design, I was immediately drawn to the idea of origami as an elegant method for sharing ideas. Paper airplanes are very universal and easy to understand symbols when communicating the ideas of "sharing" and "exchange." I wanted the logo to have the appearance of motion, to better represent the physical movement and transformation of ideas between people.</p></br></br>
