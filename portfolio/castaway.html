			<h3>The Approach &amp; Process</h3>
		</header>
		<p>Castaway is an Angular JS web application that I built from concept to working prototype as my final apprenticeship project with Bloc. Although many platforms exist for streaming and subscribing to podcasts, none of them allow users to donate or comment directly through those streaming services. Castaway looks to remedy this problem. With or without an account, users can stream content, communicate with their favorite shows and network providers, and donate while they listen. Since podcasts and networks rely so heavily on donations from listeners to function, users are encouraged to give right to the source and recieve feedback in the form of better content more often.</br></br>In the process of conceiving and building this application, I learned a lot about compartmentalizing designs for reusability. Keeping the designs and the functionality simple and repeatable were the main goals of the project. By using the sheetsu API, we implemented a simple Google spreadsheets database to feed fake data into the working prototype and give a realistic experience.</p>

			<h3>Prototyping</h3>
		</header>
		<p>Rather than test wireframe prototypes for this project, our small team put together a working, limited functionality Angular JS application. Using the sheetsu Google spreadsheets API, we hooked up a database and pulled in data from services attached to these spreadsheets. While sheetsu has its limitations, and can often timeout when too many calls are made, it worked perfectly for our simple prototype and for getting the designs into a semi-functional working state.</p></br></br>

			<h3>The Logo</h3>
		</header>
		<p>When brainstorming Castaway's logo, I wanted to play with the idea that podcasts are thought of as the new form of radio programming. Playlists in Castaway are refered to as "stations," so I wanted to use radio waves as my main inspiration. The radio waves form a 'C' on either side of the name, encasing the logo in 'sound,' similar to a person wearing large headphones.</p></br></br>
