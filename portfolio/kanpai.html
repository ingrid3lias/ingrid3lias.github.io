			<h3>The Approach &amp; Process</h3>
		</header>
		<p>The aim of this project was to successfully create and brand a fake product for a product showcase landing page. With this goal in mind, I decided to tap into my personal interest in Japan and Japanese sake.</br>For a number of years now, I have been studying up on the wide world of wine. I love learning about the cultivation and production of wine, and more recently I have become interested in sake in the same way. Living in Japan gives me access to sake that other countries could only dream of. There are hundreds of wine clubs online, but few ways to learn about Japanese sake. "Kanpai Club" was an attempt to fix that supply problem.</p>

			<h3>The Logo</h3>
		</header>
		<p>I began the process by researching a variety of wine clubs and distributors. Since there is a large market for online wine clubs, I was able to successfully distill the most important information and develop my own information architecture and hierarchy.After sketching low-fidelity wireframes to establish a manageable layout and information flow, I did extensive research into the history of sake to best determine the direction of the color palette and the logo.</br></br>Kanpai Club’s logo was born from the prefectural flag of Shimane, which is located in the south-west of the main island of Japan. Shimane is believed to be the birthplace of sake and the god of sake brewing. Since Japan is a country rooted deep in cultural traditions, it seemed appropriate to pay homage to these roots. I also found it necessary to maintain balance in the logo, since sake culture in Japan emphasizes indulgence in moderation.</p>
